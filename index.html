				<h2>How May I Help?</h2>

					<h3>Well&ndash;Organized CSS</h3>
					<p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up&ndash;to&ndash;date on the latest best practices.</p>

					<h3>Front&ndash;end Coding<!-- (PSD to HTML)--></h3>
					<p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly and accurately convert it into a webpage that is a pixel&ndash;perfect match. If you need it, I'll sign an NDA prior to doing your conversion.</p>

				<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
				<p>I've made my home base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with a circle of eclectic friends. I started out in the tech world as a computer programmer and, after several side journeys, have come full circle back as a front&ndash;end web developer.</p>
				<p>I am hooked on coding web sites. What is now possible with a website is breathtaking&mdash;although most businesses need an excellent user experience more than they need breathtaking.</p>
				<p>I love solving my clients' web problems and I love wrangling code. I can use my listening skills, eye for detail, and love of teamwork to make your website a genuine asset to your business.</p>

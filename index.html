					<h3>Front-end Coding<!-- (PSD to HTML)--></h3>

				<h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
				<p>I've made my home base in Albuquerque, New Mexico with a circle of eclectic friends. I started out in the tech world as a computer programmer and, after several side journeys, have come full circle back as a front-end web developer.</p>
				<p>I am hooked on coding web sites. What is now possible with a website can be breath taking. Though most businesses need an excellent user experience more than they need breath taking.</p>
				<p>I love solving my clients' web problems and I love wrangling code. I can us my listening skills, eye for details, and love of teamwork to get your website up to snuff.</p>

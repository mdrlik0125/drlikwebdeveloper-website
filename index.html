				<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
				<div class="half-width">
					<p>If you are like most solopreneurs and small businesses you haven’t time to mess with updating and fixing your website.</p>
					<p>You’d love to add videos and more testimonials but when? And how?</p>
					<p>Maybe your website is in serious need of a facelift. </p>
					<p>Maybe you think you can’t afford to outsource your web work.</p>
					<p>If that sounds like you, I can probably help.</p>
<p>I've made my home base in Albuquerque, New Mexico with a circle of eclectic friends. I started my career in tech and branched into other things including health coach, personal trainer and writer. I'm now returning to tech after  My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>					
				</div>
				<div class="half-width">
				<p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front&ndash;end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>
